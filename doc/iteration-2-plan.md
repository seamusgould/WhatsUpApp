# Iteration 2 Plan
### Use Case: Upvote/Downvote Activity
*A page that displays the details of an activity and allows users to upvote or downvote an activity. After an activity is upvoted or downvoted, the activity's upvote/downvote score and the activity poster's karma are updated to reflect the action.*

### Justification of Choice
It is critical to be able to view an event in detail because this is a precondition for upvoting, downvoting, or leaving a comment on an activity post. A post's upvote/downvote score is one of the components displayed on the activity list and upvoting or downvoting an activity is a fairly frequent use case, so it is important to implement this feature in this second iteration.

### Iteration 2.0

*Features Needed*:
- Ability to select a single activity when viewing collection
- Display a single activity in detail - display name, date, time, location, description of the event, username of poster, and upvote/downvote score
- Ability to upvote or downvote an activity when viewing it in detail
