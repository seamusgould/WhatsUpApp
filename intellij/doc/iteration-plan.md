Iteration Plan
##Iteration Plan #1

###Use Case: Find Activity
*A page that displays the activities that are happening around campus as well as the posts from the users.*

**Justification of choice** \
After ranking the different use cases, we figured that the find activity use case ranked as one of the highest in terms of importance. It is also very pervasive and hard to add later because it is the page that users will arrive at once loging on to the app.
