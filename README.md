# Team 1E

A crowdsourcing app where people would share information about how full/active/vibrant different parts of campus are at any given moment. Could eventually be used to organize/promote events around campus. Can be extended to other schools.

VISION STATEMENT: “Our vision is to create a highly user-accessible app using iterative development techniques, with carefully considered yet flexible plans. The effort will be collaborative and will follow high standards for functional code.”

BUSINESS CASE:

The app should be centered around ease of access and public contribution.  A person should be able to post and view events on campus.  By providing an easy user interface, the objective is to make it easy enough to use so that the general public could use it without finding it burdensome.  This app could be useful for students who have free time and want to go to events on campus.

USE CASE
Club meetings
For Freshmen when they want to maneuver around campus and see what's going on around campus
Know where the parties are?
For people who are on campus during breaks...
Cultural events
Celebrations
Lectures
Free Food
Classes
Sports Events
Garage sales

Freshman is bored on a Saturday night, opens the app to find something to do. App tells him that there’s a party going on at one of the town houses. He visits and has a great time.
Club president wants to get the word out about his experimental dance collective. Uses app to let everyone know there’s free donuts if they sit through a meeting at 6PM on a Friday
